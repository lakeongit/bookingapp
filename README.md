If you are using LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) as your web server stack, you can follow these steps to run the code:

    Move the PHP files: Place the registration_success.php, registration_form.php, and the script file (containing the PHP code) into a directory within your LAMP server's document root. By default, the document root directory is /var/www/html/ on Ubuntu/Debian.

    Start the LAMP services: Start the Apache web server and MySQL database services. The specific commands to start these services can vary depending on your Linux distribution. For example, on Ubuntu, you can use the following commands:

    sql

    sudo service apache2 start
    sudo service mysql start

    Create the MySQL Database: Use the MySQL command-line interface or a tool like phpMyAdmin to create a database for your application. You'll need to create the necessary tables based on your specific project requirements. Make sure to update the database connection details (e.g., DB_HOST, DB_USERNAME, DB_PASSWORD, DB_DATABASE) in the PHP script with the appropriate values for your MySQL setup.

    Access the registration form: Open a web browser and enter the URL or IP address of your server. Append the name of the registration form file (registration_form.php) to the URL. For example, if your server's IP address is 192.168.0.10, you would enter http://192.168.0.10/registration_form.php in the browser's address bar.

    Interact with the form: Fill in the required fields on the registration form and submit the form. The script will handle the form submission, perform the necessary validation, and provide appropriate feedback based on the outcome.

Please note that the above steps provide a general guide, and you may need to make adjustments based on your specific LAMP setup or server configuration. Make sure the necessary PHP and MySQL modules are installed and configured correctly for your server.
